        <h1>Martin Connor</h1>
        <p>I am a innovative, industrious and talented <em>SHEQ Manager</em> with proven track record in creating, implementing and maintaining management systems that improve quality of product or service, manage health and safety on large manufacturing units and, reduce the environmental impact of the organisation as a whole.</p>
        <p>With over 32 years’ experience working within the <em><a href="https://www.epwin.co.uk">Epwin Group</a></em> whose business activities include the manufacture, supply and installation of low cost building products through their subsidiary companies. These include extrusion and fabrication of UPVC Windows, Doors and Cellular profile systems, Flat Glass Processing (Double Glazing Units and toughened glass), and CDM installation projects.</p>
        <p>Currently living where I was raised, Paignton on the beautiful Devon coast know as the English Riviera. I have been married to Wendy for over 30 years, and we have a daughter, Abbie-louise. I must not forget that we also live with an English Springer Spaniel called Milo.</p>
        <p>I like to play Golf, or at least try. I play off 22 and I am a member at <em><a href="https://www.teignvalleygolf.co.uk">Teign Valley Golf Club</a></em> which is set in some of the Country's most beautiful surroundings on the edge of East Dartmoor Country Park.</p>
